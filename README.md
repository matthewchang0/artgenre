This repository contains the raw code for a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify artwork into genre. The model was trained on a publicly available Kaggle dataset, and achieved a final model accuracy of 64.75%, a high value in the field. The intersection of art and AI is a unique and challenging area of research, as physical art is difficult to decipher by AI models. However, this project is novel in its model architecture and advances the existing work in the field.

This project was created as a mini-project for the Research Science Institute (RSI) 2024.
